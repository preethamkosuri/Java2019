Learning By Doing 2:
Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue enqueue and dequeue operations).
The enqueue operations put then integers 0 through 9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value.
Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur? 
(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
(b) 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
(c) 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
(d) 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
Ans: options b, c, d are the sequences which cannot occur when the client performs intermixed queue operations. 
Reason: As queues follow the principle of FIFO if the elements 0 to 9 are put in the queue in order then the first element to getdequeued is '0' no matter what so in the options (b,c,d) the first element to get dequeued is not 0.

Assignment 1:
Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (stack) push and pop operations.
The push operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the stack; the pop operations print out the return values.
Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur? 
a) 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5
b) 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
c) 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
d) 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
e) 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7 0
f) 0 4 6 5 3 8 1 7 2 9
g) 1 4 7 9 8 6 5 3 0 2
h) 2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 9 0
Ans: options b, g, f
a)  push (0)
    push (1)
    push (2)
    push (3)
    push (4)
    pop () // pops 4
    pop () // pops 3
    pop () // pops 2
    pop () // pops 1
    pop () // pops 0
    push (5)
    push (6)
    push (7)
    push (8)
    push (9)
    pop  () // pops 9
    pop () // pops 8
    pop() // pops 7
    pop() // pops 6
    pop() // pops 5
    Here we get the same sequence (4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5) as shown in the option.
   If we do the same process for every sequence we’ll not get perfect results for sequences b, g, f.
Assignment 2:
Stack s = new Stack()
While (!q.isEmpty())
	s.push (q.dequeue())
while (!s.isEmpty())
	q.enqueue(s.pop())
Ans: here, first queue will get empty and all the elements in queue were pushed to stack. Then stack will get empty while popping all elements to queue again. Now all the element were in reversed order.
